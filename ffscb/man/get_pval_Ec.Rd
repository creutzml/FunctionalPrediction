\usage{
get_pval_Ec(x, x0 = NULL, N = 1, eigen, fpc.cut = NULL,
  prec = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{function argument}

\item{x0}{Functional parameter under the null hypothesis. Zero function is assumed if it's not given.}

\item{N}{It should be '1' if 'cov' is the covariance operator for X itself, which is the default value.}

\item{eigen}{eigen decomposition of covariance function}

\item{fpc.cut}{It takes a vector of number of fPC to use in each HT. For integer values, fPC up to those values will be used. If it's a value from 0 to 1, this specifies the proportion of (estimated) variance that should be explained by the fPCs. If it is 0, all the available fPCs will be used as long as the size of eigenvalues are greater than .Machine$double.eps.}

\item{prec}{This determines the accuracy of \link{imhof}. One may try to modify this if p-value achieved in Ellipsoid form other than Epc gives negative value. It should the the form of c(epsabs, epsrel, limit).}
