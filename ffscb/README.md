## Description

This package contains example codes for inferential tools suggested in http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07771, titled 'Geometric Approach to Confidence Regions and Bands for Functional Parameters'. The top level functions take functional estimate and the covariance of it to perform hypothesis testings, construct confidence bands, and construct/visuallize hyper-rectangular regions. The inputs can be either vector/matrix or fd/bifd object from fda package.

## Installation

After installing `devtools' first, type in the following in R

```r
require(devtools)
install_github("hpchoi/fregion")
```

## Help

Help is available thorough

```r
require(fregion)
?fregion
